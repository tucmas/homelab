# homelab
This repositorion is my homelab, a former health care professional turning into IT - which I use for training sysadmin, DevOps, LEAN-principles in practice.
I have a strong background in health care, where I am known as a reliable, strong backbone for my team and unit. My colleagues have leaned heavily on me when things have gone wrong: in any system failures, incidents, critical situations, where I mostly have acted as a strong backbone for my teams and I have kept critical systems running. I do my best to make use for all of my previous experience from health care - in the IT industry in future.

# from me
I have 15+ years experience with Linux (mainly with Arch and Debian, some with other distros as well), with homelab, my own devices and also some offsite VPS's and SSH shells as well.
I am passionate about documentation, system stability, scalability, reliable backup solutions, privacy, system hardening, security and LEAN-philosophy.

# objective
Main objective of the project is to rebuild my homelab from scratch, following professional principles.
At the same time, I will pursue for appropiate certificates, focusing on Linux, sysadmin, Cloud services, DevOps and automation principles.
Further documentation will be added to the repo, as my project will make progress.

# Thanks
This repo is an open learning environment for anybody who is interested in improving anything about their homelab setups or overall in Linux.
If you have anything to contribute, ask, collaborate or you want to help me in my transition from healthcare to IT - open an issue or send me a message.
My long-term objective is to seek for junior sysadmin, DevOps etc opportunities and my GitHub profile will act as a portfolio.
